# indra2001-Sea-Border-Alert-System-For-FisherMen-using-RSSI-AND-GPS
we have been hearing about fishermen being seized by custody from other end and even killed. This is purely because of unawareness and unable to identify sea border between countries. So, we have initiated a systems using Global Positioning System (GPS) and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to notify and resist the fishermen crossing the border. We use Global Positioning System to get the current location (latitude and longitude) of fishermenâ€™s boat and Received Signal Strength Indicator to know the strength of the signal, followed further measures. This paper in brief states about various methods of tracking and resisting the fishermen on crossing the border. Navigation in the seawater areas is considered to be important aspect worn by any fishermen who goes for hunting. Basically, the tracking system is designed to make use of electronic device and a software installed in a system to track the current latitude and longitude measures and also detecting signal strength using Wi-Fi ports in the marine borders. Now-a-days, Global positioning system has been widely used in market to detect the current or another location and Received signal strength has been populated much well than before as the telecommunication driving through it. These two distinct methods would be a safe tool in terms of navigation. Eventually, our paper makes a comparative analysis on both methods in the fishermen border alert system and gives detailed description of working procedure
